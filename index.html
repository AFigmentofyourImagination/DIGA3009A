        <h2>A short summary that became long.</h2>
        <p>
          A Book of Dragons, but on the Internet. You might say it is a Website
          of Dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may say that this is what the Fandom Wiki is for, but I disagree.
          Most fans, myself included, do not like that DreamWorks tried to run
          the HTTYD franchise dry after it concluded in 2019 with HTTYD 3. This
          website is in honour of how I grew up knowing and loving this
          franchise. Before DreamWorks took over, there was a beautiful website
          that was my biggest inspiration for making this one, and that website
          was the Dragonpedia.
        </p>
        <h3>What happened to Dragonpedia?</h3>
        <p>
          Long story short, DreamWorks shut it down and merged the barebones of
          it into their main website that is borderline impossible to navigate.
          Many of the sections and features were eliminated. Things like the
          Dragonpedia. I have searched high and low for what happened and I
          still can't say. It's like they wanted it to disappear...
        </p>
        <h3>My thoughts</h3>
        <p>
          I know that the official site had a maximum of 23 dragon entries and
          there are 63 dragons spotted and/or mentioned in the main franchise.
          But it feels wrong to me to not have that kind of website without
          needing to needle through information on what is known and what is
          brought up in the games or the post HTTYD 3 era. There is another site
          that I found during my research, a hidden gem that I wanted to take
          inspiration from.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brilliant website that inspired me:
