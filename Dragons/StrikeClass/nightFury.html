          <img src="../../Images/strikeClass/Strike.webp" alt="Strike Class" />

        <h2>All appearances:</h2>
        <p>Features in every media</p>
        <h2>Behaviour and personality:</h2>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          According to the Dragon Manual, the Night Fury is considered to be so
          mysterious and feared, that it was often called the "unholy offspring
          of lightning and death itself." Night Furies are generally very
          aggressive to any form of threat that they find, similar to how most
          dragons used to treat the Vikings of Berk.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          The Night Fury, unsurprisingly for its rarity, is an enigmatic dragon.
          Toothless, for example, came across as aloof and distrusting when
          Hiccup first met him. He is secretive and unwilling to engage in any
          form of contact, trying to avoid the boy repeatedly. Furthermore, in
          the first film, Hiccup says that a Night Fury "never steals food,
          never shows itself, and never misses." The Night Fury is a solitary
          dragon, never one to steal directly for his Alpha and unwilling to
          reveal himself.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Though they keep themselves closely guarded when they warm up to
          others, Night Furies are also curious creatures that attempt to
          understand new things they observe and are intelligent enough to
          attempt to recreate the actions that they see. They are also extremely
          playful and intrigued by the smallest of things like flying sparks.
          Night Furies seem to be social when it comes to other kinds of
          dragons. They are also brave and not easily daunted.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Night Furies are very capable of communicating, and seemingly
          understanding human speech: the best evidence of this is when
          Toothless makes a noise in agreement with Hiccup regarding the fact
          that the Red Death can fly or when Hiccup orders Toothless not to kill
          Astrid and Stoick. They are also fiercely loyal and protective.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          The third film revealed that Night Furies are known to mate for life.
          However, the mating ritual of the Night Furies remains unknown despite
          how Toothless follows the Light Fury dancing.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Night Furies greatly resemble cats, dogs, and bats. Such behaviour can
          be seen when Toothless licks himself and scratches himself, just like
          cats do. Night Furies resemble bats because they hang upside down when
          sleeping, are nocturnal, and use some form of echolocation. They also
          resemble dogs in how Toothless walks in a circle before lying down,
          and is playful and very loyal when trained, and know to focus on what
          humans are saying.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Outdoors, they will hang downwards from near the base of the tail,
          with the tail fins hanging directly in front of the face, and wings
          wrapped loosely around the body. They are also able to do so in caves,
          although it appears the tail is needed differently and does not hang
          downward.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Sometimes when they are getting ready to sleep, they singe the ground
          with their fiery breath, while walking in a circle, much as dogs do
          before laying down.

        <h2>Trivia:</h2>
        <ul>
          <li>
            The Night Fury was originally inspired by a black panther
            screensaver on one of the story artist's monitors. DeBlois says that
            the image was 'striking and electrifying, with those eyes staring
            out from the darkest black face'. Some of the Night Fury's movements
            were inspired by one of the animators cats and other animals.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury's personality, appearance, and behaviour is a mix of
            a horse, wombat, kangaroo, bat, snake, dog, cat, panther, and a bird
            of prey.
          </li>
          <li>
            Night Furies were designed to be the most mammalian of dragons and
            were made to be 'cleaner, sleeker, and stealthier' than other
            dragons. The Night Fury's pure black skin proved as a major
            difficulty, as the artistic team had to portray it under a variety
            of lighting conditions. Sabrina Riegel adds that they had created a
            texture in which the Night Fury's skin resembled more of that of a
            shark or stingray, instead of a reptile's. It was also said to be
            inspired by that of a bat. This dragon species was carefully crafted
            to make sure its intelligence and emotional personality came through
            without anthropomorphizing it. The Night Fury's behaviour, similar
            to that of common pets, —cats, dogs, and horses—, were intended to
            evoke relatable emotions from viewers.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury's first smile was inspired by Simon Otto's son's
            first smile.
          </li>
          <li>
            While the Night Fury is adapted to hunting and flying in the night,
            Toothless is mostly active during the day. He likely adapted to
            diurnalism so that he could match his activities to the Vikings' and
            spend more time with Hiccup.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury is the only dragon species confirmed to be extinct.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury's dive-bombing capability, as well as the shrill
            whine associated with it, appears to be inspired by the real-life Ju
            87 dive-bomber used by the Luftwaffe in World War II. The Ju 87 was
            outfitted with sirens that emitted a high-pitched noise similar to
            that of the Night Fury as it pulled into a dive. It's also the sound
            my computer makes when I boot up the Sims 4 with mods.
          </li>
          <li>
            There is a theory from YouTube by Hello Future Me that the Night
            Fury's natural habitat is caves, since Toothless is more willing to
            go in the tunnels than other dragons. Also, because he is able to
            echolocate.
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury is the symbol for the Strike Class, and upon looking
            closely, the symbol only has one tail fin, suggesting that Toothless
            is the individual depicted. (Old symbol)
          </li>
          <li>
            The Night Fury's rounded conical face, large almond-shaped eyes, ear
            tendrils, and wide mouth containing peg-like teeth resemble that of
            the alien "Experiment 626" from the Disney film Lilo & Stitch. This
            is no coincidence, as both Dean DeBlois and Chris Sanders were also
            involved in that film, and incorporated Stitch's features into
            Toothless, likely to make him seem both frightening at times and
            endearing in others.
