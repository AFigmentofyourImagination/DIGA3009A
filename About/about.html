        <h2>Creator</h2>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          I am a student who made this website for my finals in 2025. This is
          purely for a hyperfixation I have had ever since I can remember, I
          cannot remember my life before this franchise invaded my brain and set
          up shop in there. An important thing I told myself during this whole
          process is that it is ok to mess up a little, because I am human, and
          I am learning. I don't need to know everything right now.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          For those who are curious, here is the process, and the decisions, and
          my thoughts throughout making this website. This section is mainly for
          me to vent, and so anyone who reads it sees that a lot of emotion and
          energy went into this project, maybe even soothe someone who is also
          spiralling during their finals and see that you do make it out on the
          other side.
        </p>
        <h3>Original summary for the index</h3>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          A Book of Dragons, but on the Internet. You might say it is a Website
          of Dragons.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Some may say that this is what the Fandom Wiki is for, but I disagree.
          Most fans, myself included, do not like that DreamWorks tried to run
          the HTTYD franchise dry after it concluded in 2019 with HTTYD 3. This
          website is in honour of how I grew up knowing and loving this
          franchise. Before DreamWorks took over, there was a beautiful website
          that was my biggest inspiration for making this one, and that website
          was the Dragonpedia.
        </p>
        <h4>What happened to Dragonpedia?</h4>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Long story short, DreamWorks shut it down and merged the barebones of
          it into their main website that is borderline impossible to navigate.
          Many of the sections and features were eliminated. Things like the
          Dragonpedia. I have searched high and low for what happened and I
          still can't say. It's like they wanted it to disappear...
        </p>
        <h4>My thoughts</h4>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          I know that the official site had a maximum of 23 dragon entries and
          there are 61 dragons spotted and/or mentioned in the main franchise.
          But it feels wrong to me to not have that kind of website without
          needing to needle through information on what is known and what is
          brought up in the games or the post HTTYD 3 era. There is another site
          that I found during my research, a hidden gem that I wanted to take
          inspiration from.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          A brilliant website that inspired me:
          <a href="https://httyd-unofficial.github.io" id="extLink"
            >httyd-unofficial
          </a>
        </p>
        <h3>API and Feedback</h3>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          I have searched and I could not find a single thing that would give me
          an answer as to how to do this. Everything I have tried either failed
          or was too confusing for me to understand. What I have now is
          hopefully correct. At the time of writing this part of my thoughts, it
          is the 6th, and I am so burnt out, I want to cry in my mother's arms
          until everything is ok again.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Ok, I have figured it out, I was spiralling. To be fair to me, all of
          my Google searches didn't have what I needed. My feedback system now
          has a Google spreadsheet where it stores any submissions I get.
          Currently, only I can read them, if the person who is marking my
          project needs access to it to verify that it works, I put my email in
          the GitHub notes for the commit of the final feedback system. It would
          be under the "edited and feedback" comments.
        </p>
        <h3>GSAP</h3>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Honestly, I still think some of the GSAP animations we are required to
          add are, for lack of a better term, unnecessary. Yes, it is important
          for us as students to learn how to use all the tools, but I think part
          of learning is that knowing when it is not needed for a good website.
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          Despite my opinions, I added them with the limited time I had left.
          Let me be clear, I did not leave it until the last second, but I got
          overwhelmed and it lead to burn out and mental fog. In order to be
          kind to myself, I kept them simple as I did not want to overwhelm the
          user. Because it needed to be across all the pages, I decided to add
          the GSAP timeline to the navigation (it seemed pretty), only let some
          paragraphs and lists be affected by the ScrollTrigger, and have the
          logo spin when loading into the page (very cute). On each page, there
          are 4 or more elements that uses GSAP, including this paragraph.
        </p>
        <h3>Checking the requirements</h3>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          I was tiredly reading through what I still had left to do when I saw
          that my API needed to be linked to my filter system. Queue the panic!
          (Also why is queue spelt like that?) I was ready to run to my mom at 4
          in the morning to cry. I couldn't afford to fail to meet any
          requirements, no matter how tired I was. The first thought running
          through me was, "Why do they need to be linked? What do they mean the
          two are connected? Does that mean my feedback API means nothing?!"
        </p>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          What I have decided, because I still need to complete all the dragon
          entries, that I should leave it. My lecturers can see I did add an
          API, and a filter system. In my website, I do not see how the filter
          system and API can be linked. This is where I pessimistically believe
          I will lose marks. I can only hope and pray it doesn't sink my grade.
        </p>
        <h3>Things I would add or change if I had more time / experience.</h3>
        <p class="scrollAnim">
          I would definitely add some small section where the terms of some
          things, like Dragon Root, are explained or a pop-up to explain what it
          is if I had more time. I would also have made it a bit more fancy in
          the design. With making this website, I have learned that I might have
          bitten off more than I can chew in regards to the content itself. But
          I wanted to showcase something I love. Maybe for the next website I
          make, I'd go for something a bit easier.
