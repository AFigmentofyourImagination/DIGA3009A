        <h2>Creator</h2>
        <p>
          I am a student who made this website for my finals. This is purely for
          a hyperfixation I have had since I can remember, I cannot remember my
          life before this franchise invaded my brain and set up shop in there.
          An important thing I told myself during this whole process is that it
          is ok to mess up a little, because I am human, and I am learning. I
          don't need to know everything right now.
        </p>
        <h2>History</h2>
        <p>
          For those who are curious, here is the process, and the decisions, and
          my thoughts throughout making this website. This section is mainly for
          me to vent, and so anyone who reads it sees that a lot of emotion and
          energy went into this project.
        </p>
        <span></span>
        <h3>Original summary:</h3>
        <p>
          A Book of Dragons, but on the Internet. You might say it is a Website
          of Dragons.
        </p>
        <p>
          Some may say that this is what the Fandom Wiki is for, but I disagree.
          Most fans, myself included, do not like that DreamWorks tried to run
          the HTTYD franchise dry after it concluded in 2019 with HTTYD 3. This
          website is in honour of how I grew up knowing and loving this
          franchise. Before DreamWorks took over, there was a beautiful website
          that was my biggest inspiration for making this one, and that website
          was the Dragonpedia.
        </p>
        <h4>What happened to Dragonpedia?</h4>
        <p>
          Long story short, DreamWorks shut it down and merged the barebones of
          it into their main website that is borderline impossible to navigate.
          Many of the sections and features were eliminated. Things like the
          Dragonpedia. I have searched high and low for what happened and I
          still can't say. It's like they wanted it to disappear...
        </p>
        <h4>My thoughts</h4>
        <p>
          I know that the official site had a maximum of 23 dragon entries and
          there are 61 dragons spotted and/or mentioned in the main franchise.
          But it feels wrong to me to not have that kind of website without
          needing to needle through information on what is known and what is
          brought up in the games or the post HTTYD 3 era. There is another site
          that I found during my research, a hidden gem that I wanted to take
          inspiration from.
        </p>
        <p>
          A brilliant website that inspired me:
          <a href="https://httyd-unofficial.github.io">httyd-unofficial </a>
        </p>
        <span></span>
        <h3>API and Feedback</h3>
        <p>
          I have searched and I cannot find a single thing that would give me an
          answer as to how to do this. Everything I have tried either failed or
          was too confusing for me to understand. What I have now is hopefully
          correct, but just in case, I will try and add another API to ensure I
          didn't completely screw this up. Honestly, I have no idea what my
          lecturers want from me here. At the time of writing this part of my
          thoughts, it is the 6th, and I am so burnt out, I want to cry in my
          mother's arms until everything is ok again.
